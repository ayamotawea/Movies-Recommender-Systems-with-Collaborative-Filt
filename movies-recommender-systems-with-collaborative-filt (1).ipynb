The dataset has been reduced in size to focus on movies from the years since 2000. This dataset consists of ratings on a scale of 0.5 to 5 in 0.5 step increments. The reduced dataset has $n_u = 443$ users, and $n_m= 4778$ movies. \n\nBelow, you will load the movie dataset into the variables $Y$ and $R$.\n\nThe matrix $Y$ (a  $n_m \\times n_u$ matrix) stores the ratings $y^{(i,j)}$. The matrix $R$ is an binary-valued indicator matrix, where $R(i,j) = 1$ if user $j$ gave a rating to movie $i$, and $R(i,j)=0$ otherwise. \n\nThroughout this part of the exercise, you will also be working with the\nmatrices, $\\mathbf{X}$, $\\mathbf{W}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$: \n\n$$\\mathbf{X} = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n--- (\\mathbf{x}^{(0)})^T --- \\\\\n--- (\\mathbf{x}^{(1)})^T --- \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n--- (\\mathbf{x}^{(n_m-1)})^T --- \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} , \\quad\n\\mathbf{W} = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n--- (\\mathbf{w}^{(0)})^T --- \\\\\n--- (\\mathbf{w}^{(1)})^T --- \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n--- (\\mathbf{w}^{(n_u-1)})^T --- \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix},\\quad\n\\mathbf{ b} = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n b^{(0)}  \\\\\n b^{(1)} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nb^{(n_u-1)} \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\\quad\n$$ \n\nThe $i$-th row of $\\mathbf{X}$ corresponds to the\nfeature vector $x^{(i)}$ for the $i$-th movie, and the $j$-th row of\n$\\mathbf{W}$ corresponds to one parameter vector $\\mathbf{w}^{(j)}$, for the\n$j$-th user.
